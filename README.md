## Lara Blog

Simple blog made with Laravel having CRUD functionality.

Front page is just for show, no actual content there.

In the blog part of website logged in user can create, edit and delete their posts.

All inputs during creation and edit of posts are sanitized and validated.

Wasted a lot of time setting up navigation panel.

Little bit of alpine.js used for the user dropdown in navigation panel.

No admin functionality yet.

For search query only characters and number are allowed, its a simple db query that searches through both title and content of all blog posts.
